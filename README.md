### Description of Idea

##### Problem : In India, almost everyday there are over 5000+ cases of kidnapping, death, extortion, rape etc. but still there is no solid solution to overcome this problem. 2 out of every 3 person in India own a smartphone, they use it for solving maximum of their daily life problems then why can't we make it usable to help us avoid this kind of overgrowing cases. Women are the most vulnerable victims to these kinds of cases ; then why can’t we empower them with technology to at least give them an opportunity to save their lives.

##### Idea : In order to solve this problem, we are coming up with a revolutionary app, Safe-Her . Safe-Her is a mobile application which helps you to send messages containing your location, your current address as well as with a google map link directly to your saved contacts. Along with that we are also building a feature that helps your family members track your live location in real time so that your help isn’t disguised with a different location.

##### Future Scope : As the technology is growing faster and faster everyday, there is always a new scope of tech that can be used to solve problems of the people. As the future of our product, we see to integrate a voice note nudge feature along with a text message. We also aim to build an AI powered app with Alan AI which automatically recognizes for a particular instruction and sends away necessary notifications to your family without even opening the app.
